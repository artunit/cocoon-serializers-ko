Project: Cecil serializer

This a cocoon serializer to be built against trunk. If you just want to use
the serializer itself, you just need the jar file. The application uses the
Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) library for handling images. The JAI achieves
the greatest efficiency at the time of this writing using TIFF files.

Python has met and maybe even surpassed Java's image capabilities, and I
would like to port this to django at some point. The highlighting is based
on having a lucene index for the terms on a page.
